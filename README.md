# bigStickForms

I was approached by our sales team about difficulties reading form submission emails from our site. I was tasked to create a custom HTML CSS template to format new incoming emails from Webflow. I will use Zapier / Gmail integration to accept Webflow submissions, parse the information to my template, and send this parsed and styled email to the sales team. 

Clients request quotes through our site using a complex form with 33 different input options. The default email we receive was dense with no formatting. They told me they have trouble reading and tracking information quickly and accurately, and were making frequent errors when completeing quotes because of this. Quote request is the core of the Big Stick business.

Hearing out these concerns, I knew the new product had to prioritize clarity and processing speed. I started the wireframing process in Figma with our first prototype. After bringing this design to the sales time, they found info clarity to be very high, but they found the speed at which they process info to be slow.

 i chose a monospaced font blah blach
After the first round of UX prototyping, I asked them open ended questions blah blahc


I wen tback and conducted desktop research and refined the design further. I decided to break out info into tables and using a monospaced font to make the form input key and values evenly spaced and predicatably positioned. This will help with the eye tracking and reading information faster. I eliminated visual clutter further by removing color, and the dark grid borders that were not useful in this size of grid. Instead of lengthy URL links to externally hosted data, I replaced them with buttons to further remove clutter.
