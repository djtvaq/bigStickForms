# bigStickForms

I was approached by our sales team about troubles reading form submission emails from out site. Clients request quotes through our site using a complex form with 33 different input options. The default email was dense with no formatting. They told me they have trouble tracking information by eye, reading information concisely, and were having errors when completeing quotes because of this. Quote request is the core of Big Stick business.

Hearing these concerns, I knew the new product had to prioritize clarity and processing speed.


Creating an email template to format incomiing form quote submmissions via Webflow.


I will use Zapier / Gmail integration to accept Webflow submissions, parse the information to my template, and send this parsed and styled email to the sales team.
