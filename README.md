# bigStickForms

Creating an email template to format incomiing form quote submmissions via Webflow.

The current form submissions emails contain no styling. Big Stick has complex quote request forms on their site, and the sales staff are having trouble parsing information.

I will use Zapier / Gmail integration to accept Webflow submissions, parse the information to my template, and send this parsed and styled email to the sales team.
